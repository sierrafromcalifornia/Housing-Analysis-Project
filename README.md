This project analyses the housing industry as we compile valuable intel for homeowners considering whether home improvement projects will add value to the sale value of their homes. We have been charged with helping a client in King County, WA forecast the potential monetary effects of particular home improvement projects in their county. We'll use X datasets to TBD.

## Business Understanding

A client in King County, WA wants to advise homeowners on home improvement projects that will add to the sale value of their homes.

These three claims can be addressed directly with the three datasets (from the King County Department of Assessments) described later in this document:

1. Enclosing a porch will increase the sale price of a home.1
2. Converting a garage to a bedroom is a good way to increase the sale price of a home.2
3. Upgrading to a forced-air heating system will increase the sale price of a home.3,4

Your task is to build a linear regression model to represent home sale prices in King County, and use it to advise homeowners on which home improvement projects will add to their home sale values.

## Data Understanding

Data will be used from the following sources:
*

TODO: add data understanding, including at least 3 high-quality visualizations

## Data Preparation

TODO: add data preparation (which can be quite brief, but make sure you explain any dropped records)

## Modeling

TODO: add modeling.  What are the features of your final model?

## Methods & Results

TODO: add evaluation.  How well does your model meet the assumptions of linear regression?

## Conclusion

TODO: add conclusion.  How does your model answer the business question?
